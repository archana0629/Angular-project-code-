This project contains StockXIndex.html which is the main file that needs to be executed.
It displays Shoe inventory grid.
On clicking on a slot, the add,edit,remove button prompt appears. 
On clicking on edit, it takes us to another page called StockXForm.html that displays the shoe information like Brand,Size,Style,Id
in tabular format.

Challenges faced:
->On clicking on a particular slot, the prompt appeared for other slots as well. I think I need to implement using more than one controller
for each of the slot div.

Note:
Pls place all images attached to images folder since I ve given relative links in the StockXIndex.html file.
